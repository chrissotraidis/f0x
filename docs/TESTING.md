# Testing ledger

## 2026-08-11 — Gate 0 source audit

- **Environment:** Apple Silicon macOS 26.6, Xcode 26.6, CMake 4.4.0, Ninja
  1.13.2.
- **Pinned source:** recursively cloned `Zorkats/G-Diffuser` at `719fd82`.
- **Verified by source:** non-Windows currently selects `gdx_fiber_ucontext.c`;
  G-Diffuser's public README documents Windows/Linux only; the current default
  has `GDX_EXPANSION_KIT=ON`; Fast3D/libultraship is the renderer layer.
- **HarkinianPad benchmark inspected:** README and build/release/evidence
  documentation at commit `1197472`; its clear install-status table, strict
  ROM-free audit, source pinning, evidence-led claims, and separation of
  physical-device from Simulator proof are adopted as F0X documentation rules.
- **Not yet tested:** configure, compile, renderer initialization, fibers,
  game boot, controller, audio, save, Simulator, or physical hardware.

## 2026-08-11 — Gate 1 macOS ARM64 compile/link

- **Command:** `cmake -S ref/G-Diffuser -B build/macos-baseline-clean -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DGDX_EXPANSION_KIT=OFF -DPython3_EXECUTABLE=build/python-build-tools/bin/python && cmake --build build/macos-baseline-clean --target G-Diffuser --parallel 4`
- **Result:** passed. `build/macos-baseline-clean/port/G-Diffuser` is a Mach-O 64-bit arm64 executable; Metal, QuartzCore, CoreAudio, and AudioToolbox are linked.
- **Smallest fixes, all source-proven:** Darwin private-libc header compatibility; `_XOPEN_SOURCE=700` for the existing ucontext backend; Darwin relative `nanosleep` implementation of the existing absolute pacer; Linux-only ELF RPATH/version script; cartridge-only stubs for dormant Expansion Kit references.
- **Build-only Python environment:** ignored `build/python-build-tools` with PyYAML and Pillow; no host Python was modified.
- **Not established:** process launch, Metal initialization, fiber switching, ROM loading, title screen, gameplay, input, audio, or persistence.

## 2026-08-11 — Gate 2 Apple ARM64 fiber proof

- **Command:** `cmake --build build/macos-baseline-clean --target gdx_fiber_smoketest --parallel 4 && ./build/macos-baseline-clean/port/gdx_fiber_smoketest`
- **Result:** passed: three independent default-size stacks made 30,000 deterministic switches with per-fiber canaries intact.
- **Fix discovered by the regression:** `_XOPEN_SOURCE` exposed Darwin's ucontext declarations but hid `MAP_ANON`; adding `_DARWIN_C_SOURCE=1` restored anonymous stack mappings. Darwin uses the existing `pthread_self` fallback instead of the Linux-only `syscall(SYS_gettid)` path.
- **Boundary:** this is macOS host evidence only. The same proof remains required on physical ARM64 iPad before device support may be claimed.

## Next experiment

Run the documented cartridge-only macOS Debug configure/build, capture the
complete output in `docs/evidence/baseline/`, and reduce the first failure to
the smallest reproducible source or environment issue.
